Genome Assembly Lift-over 
The linkage markers and structural gene annotations used for QTL mapping were originally based on version 1 of the Brachypodium distachyon genome assembly (Phytozome v9, Bdistachyon_192). To compare these marker and gene positions to assembly version 3 (Phytozome v10, Bdistachyon_314), a lift-over process was performed. Assembly version 1 was aligned to version 3 using Minimap2 (version 2.28-r1209) with default parameters. The resulting alignments were processed using the liftover command from paftools (included with Minimap2), enabling the correspondence of marker and gene positions between the two assemblies at single-base resolution.
